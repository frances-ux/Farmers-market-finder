# Farmers Market Finder

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my CodeSquad project - Farmers Market Finder. Check out the web app at [Farmers Market Finder](https://farmers-market-finder.cyclic.app/).

## What is Farmers Market Finder?

Farmers Market Finder was created to help the community of St. Augustine locate farmers markets in their area. As a recent transplant to St. Augustine, I seeked a way to find healthy, sustainable food options while also supporting local farmers and artisans. I love bringing my young child to local parks and playgrounds around my community - we always have a great time playing and moving. Unfortunately, sometimes when visiting my local parks, I've noticed trash floating around the park - it gets stuck under the playground equipment, blown up against the fences, and scattered into the surrounding wooded areas. My heart breaks every time we have this experience. In the past, I've cleaned up our local park a bit here and there. It feels good to do something good for my community. 

With this website, I'm hoping to start a movement. We can all feel good about supporting our local community while eating healthy, nutritious meals.

## The development process

I started at the bottom with the concept, sitemap, wireframes, and mood board. Next up, let's start coding! I coded the HTML portion of the site first, and then added styling to make the site accessible and responsive. I utilized Javascript to make the site as fun and interactive as possible. 

For the backend, I used Node.js with Express/EJS and MongoDB with CRUD operations to allow users to enter data via the forms, search the database, and allow admin to update and delete data as necessary.
