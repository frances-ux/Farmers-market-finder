## What is Farmers Market Finder?

Farmers Market Finder was created to help the community of St. Augustine locate farmers markets in their area. As a recent transplant to St. Augustine, I seeked a way to find healthy, sustainable food options while also supporting local farmers and artisans. It is important to me to work on projects that will promote the wellbeing of others and serve my community. With rising inflation, it can be tough to find affortable, healthy food options. My goal is to bring the focus back to the local economy and support farmers directly while also encouraging people to live sustainably. It feels good to do something good for my community. 

With this website, I'm hoping to start a movement. We can all feel good about supporting our local community while eating healthy, nutritious meals.
